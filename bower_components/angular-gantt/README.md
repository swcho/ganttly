A Gantt chart directive for AngularJS without any other dependencies.

###<a href="http://schweigi.github.io/angular-gantt/index.html" target="_blank">Latest Release Stable Demo</a>

###<a href="http://rawgit.com/Schweigi/angular-gantt/master/demo.html" target="_blank">Master Branch Unstable demo</a>

### Features
- Usable with or without Bootstrap 3
- Every task has its own color, subject, date (from, to)
- Tasks can be moved and resized
- Rows combine multiple tasks and can have independent descriptions
- Rows can be sorted by description, date and custom order
- A user can drag&drop a row to sort it in custom mode
- Events on scroll, click, add or update
- Configurable (e.g. day or hour scale, weekend days, ..)

### Missing / To improve
- Add support for US week numbers. Currently all week numbers are according to ISO 8106.

### Requires
- AngularJS >= 1.2.16

### Install

#### Automatically (Using [bower](http://bower.io/), [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) & [grunt-wiredep](https://github.com/stephenplusplus/grunt-wiredep))

1. Download and install `angular-gantt`.

    [Latest released version](https://github.com/Schweigi/angular-gantt/releases/latest) can also be installed in your project using [Bower](http://bower.io/)

        bower install angular-gantt --save
    
    [Master branch version](https://github.com/Schweigi/angular-gantt/tree/master) contains bleeding edge features, but may be very unstable.

        bower install angular-gantt#master --save

2. Wiredep your dependencies to automatically add [angular-gantt.js](assets/angular-gantt.js) and [gantt.css](assets/gantt.css) files to your HTML index, with all other dependencies declared in your project.

        grunt wiredep

#### Manually

1. Download angular-gantt.
    [Latest released version](https://github.com/Schweigi/angular-gantt/releases/latest) is available to 
    [download](https://github.com/Schweigi/angular-gantt/releases/latest) on Github. 
    
    [Master branch version](https://github.com/Schweigi/angular-gantt/archive/master.zip) contains bleeding edge features, but may be very unstable.

2. Copy the files [assets/angular-gantt.js](assets/angular-gantt.js), [assets/gantt.css](assets/gantt.css) and [template/gantt.tmpl.html](template/gantt.tmpl.html) to your project. For a sample app see the files [demo.html](demo.html) and [assets/demo.js](assets/demo.js).

3. Add the [gantt.js](assets/angular-gantt.js) and [gantt.css](assets/gantt.css) files to your HTML code.

        <head>
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/gantt.css"/>
        </head>
        <body>
            <script src="assets/angular-gantt.js"></script>
        </body>

#### MomentJS (optional)

You may add the optional dependency [momentJS](http://momentjs.com/) to have more 
[date format](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/) features, better
[timezone support](http://momentjs.com/timezone/) and proper parsing from 
[ISO 8061](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) strings.

To work properly, moment should be linked before angular-gantt.js

        <head>
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/gantt.css"/>
        </head>
        <body>
            <script src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.8.3/moment.js"></script>
            <script src="assets/angular-gantt.js"></script>
        </body>

Angular works well without momentJS, but rely on native Date parsing and format functions of your browser.

### Usage

1. Include the module `gantt` to your Angular app modules.

        var myApp = angular.module('myApp', ['gantt']);
2. Put directive `gantt` into your HTML code at the position you would like to show the Gantt chart.

        <gantt></gantt>
3. Any operation on the Gantt (like loading data) must be made after the chart has been initialized. The event 'on-gantt-ready' can be used to get notified as soon as this is the case.
        
    ###### HTML
    
        <gantt on-gantt-ready="ganttInitialized()"></gantt>
        
    
    ###### JavaScript
        
        $scope.ganttInitialized = function() {
            // Start using the Gantt e.g. load data
        };
    

### Build
1. Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
3. Run `grunt` to build angular-gantt.js and angular-gantt.min.js

### Contribute
1. Create a feature branch with a meaning full name based on the `develop` branch.
2. Make all your changes inside this feature branch. Only source files located in `src/**` and `assets/gantt.css` must
be manually modified. `angular-gantt.js` and other `.js` files in `assets/**` are generated by the build (see "How to build")
and no modification should be made manually to those files. Use `grunt watch` to build `angular-gantt.js` on the fly during development.
3. After you finished adjust the `README` and the demo app.
4. Create a pull-request for your feature branch.

### Attributes
- **auto-expand** (default `none`)

  The Gantt date range will be extended if the user scroll to the left or right edge. Possible values are `both`, `left`, `right` or `none`.
  
- **allow-labels-resizing** (default `true`)

  Defines if the user can resize the row label section by himself.

- **allow-task-moving** (default `true`)

  Defines if tasks can be moved inside a row.

- **allow-task-resizing** (default `true`)

  Defines if tasks can be resized.

- **allow-task-row-switching** (default: `true`)

  If enabled the user can move a task to a different row.

- **allow-row-sorting** (default `true`)

  Defines if the user can sort the rows by himself. This will switch the `sort-mode` to `custom` as soon as the user starts with the sort.

- **center-date**

  Returns a function (`fn`) which can be called to center the specified date.

  Usage:
  Specify the gantt property:
    `center-date="scrollToDate = fn"`

  In your code call:
    `$scope.scrollToToday(new Date());`

- **current-date** (default `line`)

  Enable display of the current date.
  - `none`
  - `line`
  - `column`

- **current-date-value** (default to system current date)

  Define the current date in the chart.

  Usage:
  Specify the gantt property:
    `current-date="getToday"`

  In your code call:
    `$scope.getToday = new Date();`

- **clear-data**

  Returns a function (`fn`) which can be called to removes all rows and tasks at once.
  Take a look at the files [demo.html](demo.html) and [demo.js](assets/demo.js) to see how this callback is used.

- **column-width** (default `2`)

  How wide are the columns, 1 being 1em. This allows you add logic like `column-width="scale == 'day' ?  5 : 2"` to have wider columns for days than for other column scales.

- **column-sub-scale** (default: `4`)

  Defines how precise tasks should be positioned. By default tasks are placed in quarter steps (every 8 hour or 15 minute).
  Some examples:
  - 4 = in quarter steps
  - 2 = in half steps
  - 24 (if view-scale = day) to display them very accurate

- **filter-task**, **filter-task-comparator**

  Sets an expression to filter on visible tasks using angularJS `$filter('filter')`. 
  Value of `filter-task` is `expression`, and `filter-task-comparator` is `comparator`
  as defined in [angularJS filter filter](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/filter/filter).

- **filter-row**, **filter-row-comparator**

  Sets an expression to filter on visible rows using angularJS `$filter('filter')`.
  Value of `filter-row` is `expression`, and `filter-row-comparator` is `comparator`
  as defined in  [angularJS filter filter](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/filter/filter)).

- **first-day-of-week** (default: `1`)

  Specifies the first day of the week.
  - `0`: Sunday
  - `1`: Monday
  - `2`: Tuesday
  - `3`: Wednesday
  - `4`: Thursday
  - `5`: Friday
  - `6`: Saturday

  If specified ensures that the chart rendering starts at the from-date. This is useful for showing the chart even without any tasks, or empty time before the first task, or truncate previous tasks.

- **to-date**

  If specified ensures that the chart rendering goes at least to the end-date. This is useful for showing the chart even without any tasks, or empty time after the last task, or truncate next tasks.

- **data**

  Allows you to specify the data model for the gantt chart. An example of the data definition can be found in [demo\_sample\_data.js](assets/demo_sample_data.js).

- **header-show-month**, **header-show-week**, **header-show-day**, **header-show-hour**

  Display corresponding header row.

- **header-format-month**, **header-format-week**, **header-format-day**, **header-format-hour**

  Format of header row.
  
  For `header-format-month`, `header-format-day`, `header-format-hour`
  
  If using [momentJS](http://momentjs.com/), see [momentJS#format()](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/)
  It using native date, see [angularJS date filter](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/filter/date).
  
  `header-format-week` is not formatted with [angularJS date filter](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/filter/date), but
  with [sprintf](https://github.com/alexei/sprintf.js) (`'Week %s'`).

- **load-data**

  Returns a function (`fn`) which can be called to load more data to the Gantt.
  Take a look at the files [demo.html](demo.html) and [demo.js](assets/demo.js) to see how this callback is used. An example of the data definition can be found in [demo\_sample\_data.js](assets/demo_sample_data.js).

  As an alternative, you can use the `data` property to directly assign the data model.

- **load-timespans**

  Returns a function (`fn`) which can be called to load timespans into the Gantt.
  Take a look at the files [demo.html](demo.html) and [demo.js](assets/demo.js) to see how this callback is used. An example of the data definition can be found in [demo\_sample\_data.js](assets/demo_sample_data.js).

  As an alternative, you can use the `timespans` property to directly assign the data model.

  This event is raised if the user clicks on the label header in the top section of the Gantt. Use the `evt` property on the event to access the original javascript event.

- **on-labels-resized**

  This event is raised after the user did resize the row label section.

- **on-row-added** and **on-row-updated**

  Those events are raised if a new row is added or updated. A row is updated if the custom sort order has been changed by the user.

- **on-row-clicked**, **on-row-dbl-clicked**, **on-row-context-clicked**

  This event is raised if the user clicks on a row. The event has a `row`, `date`, `column` and `evt` property you can use to detect the date clicked or to access the original javascript event.

  This event is raised if when a user starts resizing a task and when the resize operation is finished.

- **remove-data**

  Returns a function (`fn`) which can be called to remove more data from the Gantt. It is possible to remove complete rows or specific tasks.
  Take a look at the files [demo.html](demo.html) and [demo.js](assets/demo.js) to see how this callback is used.

- **show-tooltips** (default: `true`)
