# Contribute
1. Create a feature branch with a meaning full name based on the `develop` branch.
2. Make all your changes inside this feature branch. Only source files located in `src/**` and `assets/gantt.css` must
be manually modified. `angular-gantt.js` and other `.js` files in `assets/**` are generated by the build (see "How to build")
and no modification should be made manually to those files. Use `grunt watch` to build `angular-gantt.js` on the fly during development.
3. After you finished adjust the `README` and the demo app.
4. Create a pull-request for your feature branch.
